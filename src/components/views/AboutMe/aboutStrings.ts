    title: 'About me',
    content: `Hello, I'm Max, a multidisciplinary individual with a passion for designing and building intuitive, mobile-friendly web experiences using technologies like React, Typescript, Python and more. When I'm not building cool things, I'm engaging in one of my many hobbies; music, working out, doing jiu jitsu, or playing video games with friends.
    What sets me apart is my inclination for unconventional paths and translating complex applications into gratifyingly simple, performant user experiences. Let's embrace the intersection of art and science!`

    title: 'Achievements',
    content: `I am a highly motivated individual with a proven track record of success. As an endorsed drummer with over 100,000 total plays on Spotify, I had the opportunity to play professionally alongside my childhood heroes, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Drowning Pool, and more.
    In League of Legends Season 4, widely regarded as one of the most competitive and popular seasons in its history, I achieved recognition as one of the best Wukongs in North America. I utilized my gaming skills to help cover some of my college expenses.
    Furthermore, I have hands-on experience working on automotives, having personally built my first car and leveraging this skill to get a job as a mechanic for the post office. Currently, I am employed as a Software Engineer where I began my professional journey at Apple.
    Lastly, I enjoy giving back to the community. I've helped over 15 people into being competitive enough to get into a software engineering program with a 5% acceptance rate and countless more with mock interviews and critiques!`
