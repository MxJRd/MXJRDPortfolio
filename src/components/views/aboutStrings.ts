    title: 'About me',
    content: `Hello, my name is Max. I like building web applications and learning new things. My current jam is React and Typescript though I have interest in learning backend and security.
    What separates me from everyone else is seeking out the unorthodox or least trodden path. I love blending science and art together in unique ways, whether it's exploring weird time signatures, melodies and rhythm in music, playing off-meta picks in
    competitive games, or creating my own unique infusions for alcohol (I like mixology and cooking!). There's beauty and curiosity underneath every rock you choose to lift and I strive to have that philosophy shine through in my work and hobbies.`

    title: 'Achievements',
    content: `I am a highly motivated individual with a proven track record of success. As an endorsed drummer with over 100,000 total plays on Spotify, I had the opportunity to play professionally alongside my childhood heroes, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Drowning Pool, and more.
    In League of Legends Season 4, widely regarded as one of the most competitive and popular seasons in its history, I achieved recognition as one of the best Wukongs in North America. I utilized my gaming skills to help cover some of my college expenses.
    Furthermore, I have hands-on experience working on automotives, having personally built my first car and leveraging this skill to get a job as a mechanic for the post office. Currently, I am employed as a Software Engineer where I began my professional journey at Apple.
    Lastly, I enjoy giving back to the community. I've helped over 15 people into being competitive enough to get into a software engineering program with a 5% acceptance rate and countless more with mock interviews and critiques!`
